# CryptoSharpeMonteCristo
Basic framework of code I have running on a RaspberryPi that automatically sends me cryptocurrency market updates, with prices and associated technical indicators. Calculates Sharpe Ratio and runs a Monte Carlo Simulation for selected cryptocurrencies to identify the "optimised" portfolio distribution according to Modern Portfolio Theory.
